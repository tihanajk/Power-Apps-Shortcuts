# Power Apps Shortcuts

First thing you have to do is configure which shortcuts you want for each action.

Here is my recommendation:

- Alt+Shift+F - open advanced find
- Alt+Shift+G - god mode
- Alt+Shift+R - list security roles
- Alt+Shift+L - locate on form
- Alt+Shift+O - open entity list
- Alt+Shift+U - open record
- Alt+Shift+M - quick field update
- Alt+Shift+C - toggle ribbon debug
- Alt+Shift+P - see optionsets (multiselect and boolean too)
